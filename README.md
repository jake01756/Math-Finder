# Math Finder
Math Finder is a program for the TI 84 Plus CE that can find the volumes and surface areas of geometric shapes. It is still under heavy development but I thought I would share my progress with the Cemetech community. It is written entirely in TI-Basic to ensure that it would work on all OS versions. Originally I was going to write it using ICE Compiler but after consideration I wrote it in TI-Basic. This decision would pay off after TI decided on a whim to remove ASM support. A TI-Nspire CX II/TI-Nspire CX II CAS port might be possible and might happen someday. But that might be far off because of the lack of good programming on it. That lack would require a significant change in the program.
